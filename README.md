# randomWallpaper
Bash script to select random wallpaper and pywal colors
Includes also the GNOME .desktop file to enable use at startup (each time you login to GNOME, you get a new wallpaper and pywal colors)
dependencies are: pyWal https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal

The path for the collection of wallpapers is on my own desktop, you should change this to where you keep your wallpapers in the .sh file.
